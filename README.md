# Alphabet-Recognition
Letter recognition using EMNIST dataset
The Alphabet Recognition project is a computer vision application that aims to recognize alphabets using OpenCV, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and image processing techniques with the EMNIST dataset. The project will use image processing techniques such as erosion, dilation, and thresholding to preprocess the dataset and improve the accuracy of the model. The EMNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten letters and digits, consisting of over 800,000 images. The project has numerous practical applications, including character recognition in documents, automated mail sorting, and handwriting recognition. 

The project will involve the following stages:

Data Collection: The EMNIST dataset will be used to gather a dataset of alphabet images. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from various sources, such as Kaggle or the official website.

Data Preprocessing: In this step,I have used EMNIST dataset for recognizing the alphabete. The collected data will be preprocessed to ensure that the images are properly formatted and standardized for the machine learning algorithm. This step involves resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to improve the accuracy of the model. The images will also undergo image processing techniques such as erosion, dilation, and thresholding to remove any noise and improve the image quality. 

Training: The preprocessed dataset will be divided into training (80% of the dataset) and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the CNN model using supervised learning techniques. The CNN algorithm will learn to recognize alphabets based on the features extracted from the input images.

Testing and Validation: Once the model is trained, it will be tested on the testing set to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The model's performance will be measured using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment: After the model is tested and validated, it can be deployed in real-world applications. The model can be integrated with various applications, such as document scanners, mail sorting machines, and handwriting recognition software.

The project's use of image processing techniques such as erosion, dilation, and thresholding to preprocess the dataset will improve the accuracy of the model by removing any noise and improving the image quality. These techniques are used to enhance the image features that are relevant to the recognition task, making the recognition process more efficient and accurate.

Overall, the Alphabet Recognition project using OpenCV, CNN, and Image Processing Techniques with the EMNIST dataset has numerous practical applications, including document processing, mail sorting, and handwriting recognition. The project showcases the power of machine learning techniques and image processing techniques in image recognition and has the potential to improve various industries' efficiency and accuracy.
